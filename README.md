# MyGame
An oldschool BBS style door game where you make movies, circa 1985 and watch them flop! For the controls just follow the prompts.
You start with a budget of 5,000,000 Dollars. You can expand your budget through outside investors, but it comes with a cost. When you run out of money, the game is over.
